=============================

5.4.1 (Fri 09/16/2016)

* Fix issue with CocoaPods Objective-C projects not building correctly

5.4.0 (Fri 09/16/2016)

* Add methods with card.io specific signatures to avoid name collisions
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/201 )
* Add .m so that CocoaPods will generate CardIO modulemap. Thanks to @keith.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/pull/210 )
* Update CardIOViewStream's previewLayer to be CALayer. Thanks to @wisolith.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/63 )
* Update CardIOVideoStream's delegate to be a UIResponder. Thanks to @reidmain.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/70 )
* Remove incorrect warning about `suppressScanConfirmation`. Thanks to @kballard.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/217 )
* Fix warnings when building from source

5.3.2 (Mon 04/11/2016)

* Fix memory management issues with CMSampleBufferRef causing crash
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/194 )

5.3.1 (Tue 01/26/2016)

* Prevent an issue with crashes when an invalid IplImage is used for
  scanning causing an exception to be thrown later in cvGetSize().
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/57 )

5.3.0 (Mon 12/21/2015)

* Add cardholder name for manual text input. Thanks to Mark Rogers and
  Martin Rybak for the contribution.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/45 )
* Add option for only numeric input for postal code.
  ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/51 )

5.2.2 (Tue 11/03/2015)

* You will need to link the `Accelerate` framework to your application.
* Fix issue where an app would hang on card-scanning screen
    ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/153 )
    If an app was displaying the card-scanning screen and was sent to the
    background, when the app was brought back to the foreground, the
    app would possibly hang on certain hardware, mainly iPhone 5S.
* Add Carthage support
    ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/36
      https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/issues/32 )
    Initial support for Carthage. In a Cartfile, you can add
    `github "card-io/card.io-iOS-source"`
    to get Carthage to build a dynamic framework for inclusion in your
    projects.
* Fix warning while running in simulator for 5.2.1
    ( https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/154 )
    Add the x86_64 and i386 slices to the OpenCV libraries to prevent warnings.
    This was also necesary for clean builds for Carthage.

5.2.1 (Mon 10/19/2015)

* Split CardIO and OpenCV libraries
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/147
     https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/issues/41)
    The library is built with Xcode 7.0 with Bitcode enabled for all 3
    libraries. The libraries are now split into 3 static libraries:
    `libCardIO.a`, `libopencv_core.a`, and `libopencv_imgproc.a`.
    This split was done to reduce the individual file size to make it
    more managable for GitHub repositories which limit individual files to
    100 MB.

    Note that when an application is "Bitcode compiled" and distributed
    by the App Store, the app size should not be signficantly increased
    compared to before Bitcode enablement.

    You must use Xcode 7 since previous versions of Xcode are not fully
    compatible with Bitcode enabled libraries.

--

5.2.0 (Wed 9/30/2015)

* Enable Bitcode
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/119)
    The library is now built with Xcode 7.0. It has Bitcode enabled which
    does significantly increase the static library. However, when an app
    is compiled and distributed by the App Store, the app size should not
    significantly increase compared to before Bitcode enablement. You must also
    use Xcode 7 since previous versions of Xcode are not fully compatible
    with Bitcode enabled libraries.

--

5.1.1 (Wed 8/26/2015)

* Update CocoaPods podspec to use `vendored_libraries`.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/pull/126)

--

5.1.0 (Sun 7/12/2015)

* Update project and sample apps for Xcode 6.4.
* Expose `scannedImageDuration` in CardIOPaymentViewController.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/pull/29)
* Better respect UISupportedInterfaceOrientation from the app plist.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/117)
* Fix iOS 9 crash by removing some obsolete localization code.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/120)

--

5.0.6 (Thu 5/21/2015)

* Prevent crash when user simultaneously taps `Cancel` and `Enter Manually` buttons.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/112)

--

5.0.5 (Tue 5/19/2015)

* Update Chinese translations for "CVV".
    (https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK/issues/278)
* Update project and sample apps for Xcode 6.3, but
    build SDK with Xcode 6.2 this one last time to prevent
    compatibility issues for clients still using Xcode 6.2.

--

5.0.4 (Tue 4/14/2015)

* Check existing video permissions before presenting camera view.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/99)

    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/104)

--

5.0.3 (Tue 3/17/2015)

* On scan cancelation, eliminate a visual stutter.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/issues/97)
* On scan completion, reset camera focus range to nonrestricted.
    (https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-source/issues/17)

--

5.0.2 (Mon 2/23/2015)

* Re-enable expiry-scanning for 32-bit devices (e.g., iPhone 4S).

--

5.0.1 (Tue 2/10/2015)

* Simplify expiry-scanning code to improve accuracy and also decrease library size a bit.
* For now, disable expiry-scanning for 32-bit devices (e.g., iPhone 4S).
  - This is because of an apparent compiler bug for which we haven't yet found a workaround.

--

5.0.0 (Tue 1/20/2015)

* Add automatic expiry-scanning.
  You can disable this feature via the new `scanExpiry` property of either CardIOView or CardIOPaymentViewController.
  Note: Expiry scans will not infrequently fail to obtain the correct expiry date.
        We are continuing to work to improve expiry-scanning accuracy.
* Remove various deprecated properties.

* The SDK now requires the OpenGLES framework.
* The SDK no longer requires the SystemConfiguration framework.
* Minor UI updates.
* Expiry is not scanned in this version.
* Scan availability notifications have been removed; scan availability no longer changes (a device either supports
  scanning or not), so notifications are unnecessary. In particular, CardIOPaymentViewController's
  +beginGeneratingScanAvailabilityNotifications, +endGeneratingScanAvailabilityNotifications,
  CardIOCardScanningDidBecomeAvailable, and CardIOCardScanningDidBecomeUnavailable have been removed.

---

2.3 (Tue 6/26/2012)

* Add JCB support.

* Added -redactedCardNumber to CardIOCreditCardInfo class.
* Improved card detection.
* Fixed minor memory leak.
* Minor data entry bug fixes.

-------------

1.1.1 (Wed 8/3/2011)
